## Let's Play JEOPARDY! 

### Why Jeopardy?
- I loved watching Jeopardy with my dad as I was growing up. With Alex Trebek passing away recently I wanted to honor him and the impact the show had on my childhood.

### About the game: 
- This is a one player version of the original Jeopardy game which starts off with 3 players or 3 teams. 
- The board consists of 5 categories and 5 clues for each category 
- There is a timer for 2 minutes

### How to play: 
- A player starts the game by clicking on the timer
- The player can choose any clue to begin with
- A pop up will appear with the clue and an input box for the player to enter their response
- Once submitted (by clicking ok) a message will appear stating if the input is correct or incorrect
- If the input is correct, the player's score will go up by the amount the clue was worth
- The clue is then disabled and cannot be played again
- Once the 2 minute timer runs out, if the player has a score of zero or a negative score, they will lose. If the player has more than zero, they win the game! 
- Once the game has ended and the result is shown, the page will automatically reload so the player can play once again.
